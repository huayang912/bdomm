A call to Result.ShowAlert(...) simply adds a java script snippet to 
the 
buffered script that will be send to the client when your server code 
stops the execution. 
For example, 
Result.ShowAlert("Hello"); 
Result.ShowAlert("Hello Again"); 
Result.ExecuteOnClient("window.open(' URL goes here ') "); 
will result in: 
1) Message "hello" displayed on the client. 
2) Message "Hello Again" displayed on the client. 
3) browser will navigate to http://microsoft.com. 
All three actions will take place only after your server code has 
finished 
the execution.
